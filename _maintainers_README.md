## Maintainers Readme

### File Name Conventions

This repository keeps a record of all iterations of each document. 

For ease of maintenance, `README.md` and `index.md` only links to the files without a `vX.X` suffix. 

When updating the new version of an existing document, upload the new version in a file without a `vX.X` suffix, and give the previous version a `vX.X` suffix in its file name. 



### _redirect

Under the current file name conventions, the `.\_redirect` folder no longer needs to be updated each time a new version of a document is uploaded. 

The old redirect files are kept because we used to send users URLs that contain version numbers.
